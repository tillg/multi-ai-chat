I will give you the list of models and their description copied over from a website within 3 backticks. Please transform it into a json with the following fields per model:
- model-id
- description
- endpoints (array of strings)
- available (boolean)

Below the 3 backticks below I copied and pasted the endpoints and which models are available per endpoint. Please complete the json accordingly.

Now let's transform the json:
- Make the mode-id a list of strings
- When the model-id contains "Beta" or "Deprecated" or "Limited beta" errase this part of the name, as it is not part of the model-id.

Result:
[

    "model-id": ["gpt-4"],
    "description": "A set of models that improve on GPT-3.5 and can understand as well as generate natural language or code",

Please add a field "family" to every entry.

------------------------------

I have 2 arrays: 
- Array allModels that contains objects with a model_id but without a desciption
- Array knownModels that contains objects with a model_id and descriptions - but not every model_id is in this array
How can I add the descriptions to the allModels array?
